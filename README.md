## Basics

This is everything we've been able to figure out about the Backrooms. Most information comes from my own personal experience, but a lot of it comes from the collective agreement of the people that have escaped. There are a lot of details that people disagree on, but everyone agrees that as soon as you enter the Backrooms, you know its name.

You enter this realm by "noclipping" out of reality. Your body stays in this world but your conscience is moved to the Backrooms. Once you exit, your conscience is put back into your original body at the exact point in time that it was taken out. However, once you've been in the backrooms, it's basically guaranteed that you'll re-enter someday. Sometimes it's years before you re-enter, and sometimes it's hours. Also, it's fairly common to noclip while in the backrooms, in which case you'll fall a random number of levels.

No one has been able to measure the size of the Backrooms, and that's mostly due to the fact that everything behind you is subject to change. Some say it's infinite, and others say it's only as big as what you are currently looking at. Despite the apparent size of the Backrooms, or perhaps the lack thereof, it is fairly common to run into other people. Due to this stressful environment, most confrontations lead to either extreme violence or instant friendship.

You cannot bring any items into the Backrooms. Every time you enter, the only things that come with you are your clothes. Some people point to this as evidence that the Backrooms aren't physically real, but they have to be real in some sense. Any damage to your body will persist after you exit, and any people you find in the backrooms can also be found in this world. In fact, most of the people that find each other in the Backrooms do end up finding each other again once they leave.

Another thing to note is that once you exit the Backrooms, you will stay in (supposedly) the real world for a second or so before your conscience is put back into your original body. This means you should be able to re-enter the Backrooms if you exited through the stairs, but no one has ever reported doing so. We strongly suggest not doing anything that's never been reported on due to the fact that people probably have tried it before and not lived to tell what happens.

# Levels

There are only 4 confirmed levels, but there may be more that are unreported. These levels are numbered here from 1 to 4, but there are no actual numberings in the Backrooms. The first level is extremely eerie, but not very dangerous. The second level is extremely creepy and very dangerous. The third level is extremely scary and dangerous. There isn't much information on the forth level, but it's said to be the worst (known) level.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Level 1

This is the level you will always start in. It has yellow walls, dark carpets, and buzzing florescent lights. There are occasionally stray objects and special rooms, but these are fairly rare (and the bathrooms never work). The reported special rooms and stray objects are listed below, under Unreported Events. As you move through this level, the wallpaper covering the walls will slowly become more and more damaged, revealing the concrete behind them, though this can take several hours.

This is the only level in which you can escape the Backrooms from. After searching long enough, you should be able to find stairs or an elevator that brings you either up or down. You can obviously see which way the stairs take you, but you can never tell which way an elevator goes. Unfortunately, it seems to be around 10 times more likely to find an elevator than to find stairs, and whether an elevator goes up or down is a 50/50 chance. Once you use an elevator, it is deactivated and cannot be used again. With stairs, however, you can go up and down all you want, as long as they don't disappear when you turn around (with an exception described below). To exit the Backrooms, all you have to do is go above level 1.

As mentioned in the first paragraph, the walls do sometimes change, but other than that, this level mostly stays the same. The only variance comes from special rooms, stray objects, and rooms where the lights have gone out. People have reported that these places are especially creepy, but we're not sure if there's something specifically making it creeper or if it's just because of how it looks.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Level 2

If the stairs / elevators bring you down instead of up, this is where you'll end up. This level seems to be a decayed exact replica of the first level, down to the placement of stray objects. The only structural differences are that the carpet is soaking wet and mildewey, the walls are moldy, and the lights are unstable, going out for minutes or even hours at a time. There are special rooms here too, but we have noticed that no one has ever reported going into them, so we suggest not doing so.

The most important thing to note here is that there are entities that live in this level. There have been reports of entities on level 1, but they're almost always in level 2 and below. These entities appear extremely deadly, but unfortunately, you forget almost everything about them once they're gone. The only thing that people can remember is that there was something that terrified them. There have been a few reports of people remembering them and giving detailed descriptions of them, but they vary so much and are so scarce that they're almost certainly fake. Even though no one has reported these entities killing anyone, it is still advised that you do not engage with them.

People have reported hearing all kinds of sounds in this level, even though some sounds shouldn't be possible. They usually consist of things like clanging pans (even though there are no (known) pans), loud flushing automated toilets (even though the toilets (in level 1) don't work), air conditioning (even though there are no ducts anywhere), etc. It is unclear whether these sounds are real or hallucinations, but the amount and consistency of reports suggests that these sounds must be real in some sense, even if their origins might not be legitimate.

Like level 1, the wallpaper here seems to change as time goes on. In addition to that, the ceiling panels and carpet also become missing / damaged the further you go out. Eventually, there are no ceiling panels, the wallpaper is completely gone, the concrete walls start cracking, and only patches of the carpet remains. Even though the reports of level 2 deterioration stop, but there's no reports of the deterioration stopping.

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Level 3

This level is the most varied within itself. It's mostly filled with long corridors, but there are also some rooms full of machinery. The corridors are filled with pipes and ducts, there aren't many lights, entities are prevalent, and some of the rooms and corridors are partially or fully flooded (from here on out I'll refer to both rooms and corridors as rooms). Rooms are separated by strong sealing metal doors, like those found in ships. This level is considered the most dangerous of the four, but traveling through it is still slightly easier than the fourth level.

Some of the pipes can get extremely hot, which can in turn make the room it's in very hot. This also makes some of the doors extremely hot, so we suggest quickly touching each door's handle with the back of your hand before opening it to test its temperature. If a room starts warming up with you inside it, you must leave as soon as you possibly can.

Unfortunately, there's not any way to know whether a room is flooded until it's too late. Every door you encounter will open inwards, which allows any liquids on the other side to force the door open. Flooded rooms have been reported to be filled with either water, sewage, tar, or almond milk. To avoid getting any of these liquids on yourself, we strongly suggest trying to climb onto whatever pipes / machinery you can before opening doors. If a room is flooded with tar, doing this might even save your life.

We can't technically tell what's in all of the pipes / ducts, but we can guess that the pipes contain water, sewage, tar, and almond milk, since that's what fills the flooded rooms. Some have reported becoming nauseous in these rooms, which may be caused by whatever leak through broken vents.

You can enter this level by stairs / elevators, but you can only exit through ladders (or the stairs you entered from). At the top of the ladder, you can open a service hatch that leads to level 2. No one has reported re-entering level 3 from these ladders. 

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Level 4

Not many people have been to this level, so we don't have much information about it. This level is entirely filled with tightly compacted pipes, wires, and ducts that are nearly impossible to squeeze between. There doesn't seem to be any floor, and no one knows how deep this level goes. Some of the pipes are burning hot, and every person that reports entering this level also reports getting burned.

The only confirmed way of entering this level is by noclipping. People have reported seeing entrances to this level through holes in the ground in level 3, but people have only reported exiting through these holes.

## Unreported events

<br />

These are events that should be possible, though no one has ever reported on it happening. This could be because something happens to the people that try these things, it could be that no one has ever even though of doing these things in the moment they have the chance to, or it could just be that no one wants to try it because it's an unreported event, which is keeping it unreported.

<br />

- Taking photos / videos
	- You can't bring items into the Backrooms, so taking photos and/or videos just isn't possible
- Re-entering the Backrooms after exiting through stairs
- Re-entering level 3 by going back down the ladder
- Entering a special level 2 room
- Level 1 or 2 wallpaper completely disappearing gone after time
- Noclipping up a level / out of the Backrooms
- Entering level 4 without noclipping
	- It should absolutely be possible to enter level 4 through a hole in the ground in level 3, but no one's every reported doing this. This is one of the few unreported events that we don't suggest people to not try.
- Finding entities on level 4
	- Not many people have been to level 4, but those who did have never reported seeing any entities. It is unclear whether this is because there are no entities in level 4 or if it's because no one has ever survived an entity on level 4.
- Falling unconscious
	- People have reported being dizzy, and people have reported almost falling unconscious, but no one has actually fallen unconscious and reported on it.
- Death
	- It may seem obvious that no one has every reported themselves dying, but the fact that no death ever has been reported is actually quite strange due to groups. It should absolutely be possible for, for instance, one person in a group to die from something in level 3, but nothing like this has ever been reported. No one knows if the reason no deaths have been recorded is because they don't happen or if it's because they don't happen to parts of groups.
- Dying to entities
	- It's pretty obvious that these entities want to kill you, but it's still worth mentioning that this has never been reported
- Finding a body
	- No one has every found a dead body. This doesn't necessarily mean that there are no deaths, since the layout of the backrooms constantly changes.

<br />

## Possible Deaths

<br />

- Starvation / dehydration
	- There aren't any resources in the Backrooms, so you'll have to get out before you die of hunger / thirst
- Overheating
	- The rooms in level 3 can get hot enough to kill you, and people have undoubtedly died from this
- Flooded in level 3
	- Some level 3 rooms are completely flooded, and if you're not careful, these liquids (especially tar) can engulf you once you open the door to it
- Entities
	- Again, there have been no reports of anyone dying to these entities, but they're still considered extremely dangerous

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Notes

<br />

- Some people say that the entities don't kill anyone, pointing to the fact that 1: [no bodies have ever been ever been reported] and 2: [it should be possible for only some people in a group to be killed (leaving the others to report it)]. Many people do believe these entities kill, partially because of the extreme fear they invoke, but also because both arguments against them killing have counter-arguments. To stay as neutral as possible, we'll just give some cases for what might be happening:
	- 1: The entities do kill, and they never leave behind bodies or witnesses
	- 2: The entities do kill, the never leave behind witnesses, they do leave behind bodies, and no one can find these bodies because of the changing nature of the backrooms
	- 3: The entities do not kill
